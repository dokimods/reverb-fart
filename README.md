# Reverb Fartinator

Used to change sound effects used in mods to reverbed fart and vine booms. Made it for the lolz.

It decorates the music play functions and randomizes the sounds from there.

Newer versions of RenPy can use the `config.audio_filename_callback` callback, but most mods are made with RenPy 7.4.5 or lower, as there are issues with transform events on the newer releases.
